# app/core

The platform-agnostic shared crate (`lofi-core`). Defines the cross-platform data model that every platform implementation populates and the UI consumes.

## Why this crate exists

LoFi runs on both GNOME (Rust + GTK4) and macOS (planned: Swift UI on top of a Rust core exposed via a C ABI). The two platforms share nothing at the windowing-system level, but they do share the *shape* of the things a launcher cares about: applications, windows, workspaces, commands.

`core` holds those shared types and nothing else. Keeping it free of platform dependencies is the whole point:

- A macOS build of `core` must compile without pulling in `gtk`, `gio`, or any Linux-only crate. Otherwise the C-ABI surface for the Swift side either breaks or has to be `cfg`-forked.
- Conversely, a GNOME build must not need anything from `objc2` or the Apple frameworks.

If a type or function needs a platform crate to exist, it does not belong here. It belongs in `app/gnome/` (or the future `app/macos/`).

## What belongs here

- Data types that describe items the launcher can show or act on, independent of how they were gathered.
- Pure logic that operates on those types (matching, ranking, configuration parsing) once it materializes.

## What does not belong here

- Gatherers. Parsing `.desktop` files, querying `org.gnome.Shell.Introspect`, walking `/Applications` — all of that is platform-specific and lives in the platform crate. `core` defines the destination type; platforms produce values of it.
- UI code.
- Anything that touches a window system, D-Bus, AppKit, or a specific filesystem layout.

## Current contents

### `Application`

A struct with three fields:

- `name` — the human-readable display string (e.g. `"Firefox"`).
- `desktop_id` — the stable identifier used to launch the app or refer to it across runs (e.g. `"firefox.desktop"`). **Invariant**: always ends in `.desktop`. The platform gatherer is responsible for normalizing this — see `app/gnome/src/apps.rs`.
- `icon` — `Option<String>` carrying an icon **identifier**, not bytes. Typically a freedesktop themed-icon name like `"firefox"`, or, less commonly, an absolute filesystem path when the `.desktop` file's `Icon=` line points at a literal file. `None` means the `.desktop` file had no usable `Icon=` line.

The identifier-not-bytes choice is deliberate: rendering happens in the UI layer where the icon theme, scale factor, and target pixel size are all known. Resolving icons here would force eager I/O at gather time and lock in answers that go stale the moment the user switches themes or moves a window between monitors with different scales.

### `Entry`, `EntryKind`, `EntryRef`, and `resolve`

`Entry` is the runtime sum type the UI consumes — currently `Entry::Application(Application)`. As `Window`, `Workspace`, and `Command` land they become additional variants.

`EntryKind` is the matching unit discriminant (`Copy`/`Hash`), useful for grouping or filtering without holding the payload.

`EntryRef` is the **persistence handle**: an enum-shaped `{type, id}` tagged with `#[serde(tag = "type", content = "id", rename_all = "snake_case")]`. Today it has one variant — `EntryRef::Application(String)` carrying a canonical `desktop_id`.

`resolve(&[Entry], &EntryRef) -> Option<&Entry>` is a linear scan that pairs `EntryRef`s back to the live `Entry`s from a gather.

`Entry` provides four match-dispatched accessors: `name()`, `icon()`, `kind()`, and `reference()`. They use exhaustive `match` (not `if let`) so that adding an `Entry` variant is a compile error until every accessor is updated.

### Why two types for one concept

Display fields drift between sessions: locale changes the display name, the user switches icon themes, an app gets renamed or its `.desktop` file moves. A history or MRU store that pickled the whole `Application` would either accumulate stale strings or have to re-key itself on every change.

`EntryRef` is the minimum information needed to point at "the same thing" across runs. Persistence layers serialize `EntryRef`. The UI receives `&[Entry]` from a fresh gather, and `resolve` rebuilds the link.

`Application` and `Entry` are **deliberately not** `Serialize`/`Deserialize`. Only `EntryRef` is. Do not "helpfully" add serde derives to the other types — that would invite callers to persist values that are guaranteed to go stale.

### Dependencies

`serde` (with `derive`) is a direct dependency solely for `EntryRef`'s tagged-enum representation. `serde_json` is a dev-dependency for the JSON round-trip test.

`Window`, `Workspace`, and `Command` will land here as their corresponding features are built out.
